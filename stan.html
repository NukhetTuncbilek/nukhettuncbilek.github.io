                        My personal website is dedicated to the memory of Stanley Charles Eisenstat, who taught me computer science when I was in college. Professor Eisenstat was an unbelievably good teacher and an expert at assigning instructive and challenging programming assignments. In my eyes, he is the gold standard at computer science and at education.
