                Note: \(\mathfrak{g}\( doesn't have to an algebra. Like how do you multiply elements? That kind of information is not given in the definition of a Lie algebra.\\

                \textbf{Chapter 9, Exercise 2: } Suppose that \(\mathfrak{g} \subset M_n(\mathbb{C})\( is a Lie algebra of matrices (with bracket given by \(XY-YX\(). Prove, without appealing to the PBW theorem, that the map \(i:\mathfrak{g}\to U(\mathfrak{g})\( in Theorem 9.7 is injective.
                \begin{proof}
                We will use the universal property of the universal enveloping algebra. Apply Theorem 9.7 where the associative algebra with identity is \(M_n(\mathbb{C})\( which contains \(\mathfrak{g}\(. The map \(j:\mathfrak{g}\to M_n(\mathbb{C})\( is the inclusion. Therefore, there exists a unique algebra homomorphism \(\phi: U(\mathfrak{g}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})\( such that \(\phi(i(X)) = j(X)\( for all \(X\in \mathfrak{g}\(. This fact implies that \(i\( is injective because if \(i(X) = i(Y)\(, then \(j(X) = \phi(i(X)) = \phi(i(Y)) = j(Y)\( which implies \(X=Y\(.
                \end{proof}

                \textbf{Chapter 9, Exercise 5: } Let \(\mu\( be any element of \(\mathfrak{h}\( and let \(W_\mu = U(\mathfrak{g})/I_\mu\( be the Verma module with
                highest weight \(\mu\(. Now let \(\sigma_\mu\( be any other highest weight cyclic representation of \(\mathfrak{g}\( with highest weight \(\mu\(, acting on a vector space \(V_\mu\(. Show that there is a surjective intertwining map \(\phi\( of \(W_\mu\( onto \(V_\mu\(.\\
                Note: It follows that \(V_\mu\( is isomorphic to the quotient space \(W_\mu/\ker \phi\(. Thus, the Verma module is maximal among highest weight cyclic representations with highest weight \(\mu\(, in the sense that every other such representation is a quotient of \(W_\mu.\(\\
                \emph{Hint: } If \(\tilde{\sigma_\mu}\( is the extension of \(\sigma_\mu\( to \(U(\mathfrak{g})\(, as in Proposition 9.9, construct a map \(\psi: U(\mathfrak{g}) \to V_\mu\( by mapping \(\alpha \in U(\mathfrak{g})\( to \(\tilde{\sigma_\mu}(\alpha)w_0\( where \(w_0\( is a highest weight vector of \(V_\mu\(.

                \begin{proof}
                Following the hint, one can show that \(\ker \psi \supset I_\mu\(, so we have a map \(\overline{\psi}:W_\mu = U(\mathfrak{g})/I_\mu \to V_\mu.\( This map is onto because \(V_\mu\( will be generated by the lowering operators applied to the highest weight vector \(w_0\(. It is also an intertwining map because \(\(\tilde{\sigma_\mu}(X)\overline{\psi}(Y) = \tilde{\sigma_\mu}(X)(\tilde{\sigma_\mu}(Y)w_0) = \tilde{\sigma_\mu}(XY)w_0 = \overline{\psi}(XY) = \bar{\psi}(\pi_\mu(X)Y),\(\(
                where \(X\in \mathfrak{g}\( and \(Y\in W_\mu\(. Therefore, it is the desired map in the problem.
                \end{proof}

                \textbf{Weyl chambers for \(\mathfrak{so}(n;\mathbb{C})\( and \(\mathfrak{sp}(n;\mathbb{C})\(.} A base for the root system of \(\mathfrak{so}(2n;\mathbb{C})\( consists of \(e_1-e_2, e_2-e_3, \cdots, e_{n-1}-e_n\( and \(e_{n-1}+e_n\(. The open, fundamental Weyl chamber of this base is \(\{(a_1,\cdots, a_n) | a_1>\cdots>a_{n-1}>|a_n|\}\(. A base for the root system of \(\mathfrak{so}(2n+1;\mathbb{C})\( or \(\mathfrak{sp}(n;\mathbb{C})\( consists of \(e_1-e_2, e_2-e_3, \cdots, e_{n-1}-e_n\( and \(e_n\(. The open, fundamental Weyl chamber of this base is \(\{(a_1,\cdots, a_n) | a_1>\cdots>a_{n-1}>a_n>0\}\(. 

                \textbf{The tensor product of the adjoint rep and standard rep of \(\mathfrak{sl}(3;\mathbb{C})\(:}
                Let \(\pi\( be the tensor product representation. The highest weight of the tensor product is \((2,1)\( and the highest vector is \(X_3\otimes e_1\(. We get an invariant subspace of the tensor product by repeatedly applying the lowering operators \(\pi(Y_1), \pi(Y_2)\( and \(\pi(Y_3).\( We don't have to apply the third lowering operator as such applications will be already counted by the first two because \([Y_1, Y_2] = -Y_3.\( This process yields the following outcomes: Present the print out.

                In other words, this process yields the 15-diml irreducible subrepresentation with highest weight (2,1) inside \(\pi\(, with the following basis (\(\otimes\( is omitted for brevity):
                \(\(X_1e_1, X_2e_2, X_3e_1, Y_1e_2, Y_2e_3, Y_3e_3,\(\(
                \(\( X_2e_1 + X_3e_2, X_2e_3 - H_2e_2, Y_3e_2+Y_1e_3, Y_2e_2+H_2e_3, \(\(
                \(\(X_3e_3-X_1e_2-H_2e_1, Y_1e_1 + H_1e_2, Y_3e_1-Y_2e_2+H_1e_3, Y_2e_1 + X_1e_3, H_1e_1 - X_1e_2.\(\(

                Next, we have to decompose the remaining nine dimensions. To do that, first identify \(X_2e_1-X_3e_2\( as an element in the orthogonal complement of the above subspace. This element turns out to be a highest weight vector because it is annihilated by the raising ops and has weight \((0,2)\(. Similarly, we apply the lowering operators to this element and get the following basis for the six dimensional representation:
                \(\( X_2e_1-X_3e_2, X_1e_2-X_3e_3-H_2e_1, X_1e_3-Y_2e_1,\(\(
                \(\( Y_3e_1-Y_2e_2-H_1e_3, Y_3e_2-Y_1e_3, Y_1e_1-H_2e_2-H_1e_2-X_2e_3.\(\(

                Finally, we have three dimensions left. To find the highest weight vector, I solved the equations \(\pi(X_i)(Y) = 0\( where \(Y\( is a linear combination of the monomials that are remaining (that are in the orthogonal complement of the direct sum of the above two subspaces). The highest vector is:
                \(\(H_1e_1+H_2e_1+X_1e_2+X_3e_3.\(\(
                That means the three dimensional space is isomorphic to \(V(1,0)\( and has basis
                \(\(2H_1e_1+H_2e_1+4X_1e_2+4X_3e_3, Y_1e_1+H_2e_2+X_2e_3, Y_2e_1.\(\(
                Thus,
                \(\(V_{(1,1)}\otimes V_{(1,0)} = V_{(2,1)}\oplus V_{(0,2)} \oplus V_{(1,0)}.\(\(

                Think about \(Hom(A,B) = A^* \otimes B, Hom_G(A,B) = (A^*\otimes B)^G\(. For two irreducible reps, tell me when the tensor contains the trivial representation.
