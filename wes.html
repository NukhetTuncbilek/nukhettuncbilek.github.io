                        <p>The Wisconsin Emerging Scholars (WES) is a program where calculus students attend small, seminar-style discussion sections. The WES sections meet for more hours per week than a normal calculus discussion section, and they are designed to challenge the students, giving them more conceptual tasks and problems. <br><br> In college, my favorite courses were seminars, where I got to ask many questions and was pushed to think harder. WES is the closest thing to a seminar in math, and I love to teach WES sections! <br><br> <b> With the WES section, you get two extra math credits. You also get to interact with me a lot more than a regular calculus student would; therefore, you can more easily ask for a recommendation letter in the future. </b> For more information, please refer to <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/wes/">our department's page for the WES program</a> or send me an email. <br><br> This semester, my WES section is for MATH 234 with Professor Cassie Williams. </p>
