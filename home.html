        <p>Hi, I'm Yunus, a math graduate student at University of Wisconsin, Madison. My advisor is Simon Marshall.</p>
        <p>My university email is <b>tuncbilek@wisc.edu</b>. </p>

<div class="container p-3 my-3 border">
        What I am doing now: I finished the second year of the math Ph.D. program at UW-Madison in May 2021.
        I have not decided on a research topic yet, but I am working on that currently. I am also preparing for the complex analysis qual in August 2021, so feel free to get in touch with me if you want to study together.

<div class="container p-3 my-3 border">
        What I did before PhD: Before moving to Madison, I was at Yale University between 2014 and 2019. 
        During the first four of those five years, I got my Bachelor of Science in computer science and mathematics. 
        Then I did a post-baccalaureate year to work with Yale economists Costas Arkolakis and Fabian Eckert, with whom I created a model for predicting coffee demand in NYC. 
        In the same year, I worked with School of Management Professor Peter Schott and Fabian to test whether the Census Bureau was randomizing enough of its data to hide the private information of American companies.
        Before those research projects, I worked at Yale's Social Robotics Lab and did a study abroad program in Berlin, Germany.

        Miscellaneous: I am from Istanbul, Turkey. My interests outside math include reading, cooking, value investing and technology. If you would like to have my personal email, please reach me at the university email.

        <p>I am planning to turn this website into a LaTeX-compatible blog of my mathematical readings. I would like to code almost all of the website myself, so it might take a while. But it is a lot of fun. </p>
